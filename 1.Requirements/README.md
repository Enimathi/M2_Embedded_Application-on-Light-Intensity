> # **Introduction**

 **Fingerprint matching has been successfully used by law enforcement for more than a century. The technology is now finding lot of other applications such as identity management and access control. In this context, an automated fingerprint recognition system and identification of key challenges are described along with the research opportunities. The description is like a product design in this report implementing RTOS (Real time operating system) under the domain of embedded system. Fingerprint Recognition is a widely popular but a complex pattern recognition problem. It is very difficult to design accurate algorithms capable of extracting salient features and matching them in a robust way. In this paper, we have come with a novel approach to simplify the existing problems with a proper Embedded System Design**


> # **Research**

**The systems employed at these places must be fast enough and robust too. Authors design a simple fingerprint recognition system using At mega 328p as core controller. The system uses R305 fingerprint scanner to capture fingerprints. This system can be employed at any application with enhanced security because of the uniqueness of fingerprints. It is convenient due to its low power requirement and portability.**

> # **Features**

• **Integrated image collecting and algorithm chip together, All-in-one**

• **Fingerprint can conduct secondary development & embedded into a variety of end products**

• **Low power consumption, low cost, small size, excellent performance**

• **Professional optical technology, precise module manufacturing techniques**

> # **Swot Analysis**

> ### **Strengths**

•	**It is highly accurate.**

•	**It is unique and can never be the same for two persons.**

•	**It is the most economical technique.**

•	**It is easy to use.**

•**Use of small storage space.**



> ### **Weakness**

**The primary disadvantage of DNA fingerprinting is that it is not 100% accurate. Contamination, falsification, and chain of custody concerns still exist with this technology. Even improper testing methods may create false positive or false negative results.**

> ### **Opportunities**

**Just as physical locks have master keys that can unlock anything, fingerprint scanners have what are called "master prints." These are custom-made fingerprints that contain all the standard features found on everyone's fingers. Hackers can use master prints to get into devices that use sub-par scanning techniques.**

> ### **Threats**

**Faking fingerprints — doable, but hard. Researchers found a way to create fake fingerprints to fool many devices, although it took a lot of effort. For years, the security of fingerprint-based authorization has been a topic of fierce debate.**
