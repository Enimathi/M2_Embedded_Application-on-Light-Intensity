# REQUIREMENTS

> # **Introduction**

 **Lighting is a factor to get a safe and comfortable environment.Good lighting allows one to see objects that are done clearly, and can give arefreshing view.Conversely, if the room has poor lighting can cause eye fatigue, therefore it is necessary to control the intensity of light-based microcontroller to regulate the lighting of a room automatically. this research was made by designing a lighting model using a dimmer circuit based onATMega328 microcontroller, LDR sensor (Light Dependent Resistor) and Bluetooth HC-06.**


> # **Research**

**In this we are going to interface LDR with ATMEGA8 microcontroller, and with this we can measure LIGHT INTENSITY in the area. In ATMEGA8, we are going to use 10bit ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion) feature to measure the light intensity.**

> # **Features**

• **Integrated image collecting and algorithm chip together, All-in-one**

• **Fingerprint can conduct secondary development & embedded into a variety of end products**

• **Low power consumption, low cost, small size, excellent performance**

• **Professional optical technology, precise module manufacturing techniques**

> # **Swot Analysis**

> ### **Strengths**

•	**It is highly accurate.**

•	**It is unique and can never be the same for two persons.**

•	**It is the most economical technique.**

•	**It is easy to use.**

•**Use of small storage space.**



> ### **Weakness**

**The primary disadvantage of DNA fingerprinting is that it is not 100% accurate. Contamination, falsification, and chain of custody concerns still exist with this technology. Even improper testing methods may create false positive or false negative results.**

> ### **Opportunities**

**Just as physical locks have master keys that can unlock anything, fingerprint scanners have what are called "master prints." These are custom-made fingerprints that contain all the standard features found on everyone's fingers. Hackers can use master prints to get into devices that use sub-par scanning techniques.**

> ### **Threats**

**Faking fingerprints — doable, but hard. Researchers found a way to create fake fingerprints to fool many devices, although it took a lot of effort. For years, the security of fingerprint-based authorization has been a topic of fierce debate.**

> # **4W's and 1H**

> ### **Who**

**Fingerprint-based security system” project can be used by the employees, staff or workers in various industries like Automobile industries, manufacturing industries, Software development companies.**


> ### **When**

**Fingerprint security system can be used for the initialization of the event, for the entry in the class, for the intime of an employee,.etc**

> ### **What**
**Fingerprint recognition allows a person to be verified or identified through the analysis and comparison of his or her finger dermal ridges. Fingerprint recognition was one of the first techniques used for automatically identifying people and today is still one of the most popular and effective biometric techniques.**

> ### **Where**

**Fingerprint scanners are security systems of biometrics. They are used in police stations, security industries, smartphones, and other mobile devices.**

> ### **How**


**A fingerprint is formed when a finger makes contact with a surface. The finger leaves behind traces of sweat and any other substances present on the finger that a suspect might have touched. These substances are deposited in the characteristic pattern of the ridges present on the finger tip of the donor.**
