* Fingerprint matching has been successfully used by law enforcement for more than a century. The technology is now finding lot of other applications such as identity management and access control. In this context, an automated fingerprint recognition system and identification of key challenges are described along with the research opportunities. The description is like a product design in this report implementing RTOS (Real time operating system) under the domain of embedded system. Fingerprint Recognition is a widely popular but a complex pattern recognition problem. It is very difficult to design accurate algorithms capable of extracting salient features and matching them in a robust way. In this paper, we have come with a novel approach to simplify the existing problems with a proper Embedded System Design *
