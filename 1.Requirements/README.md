# REQUIREMENTS

> # **Introduction**

 **Lighting is a factor to get a safe and comfortable environment.Good lighting allows one to see objects that are done clearly, and can give arefreshing view.Conversely, if the room has poor lighting can cause eye fatigue, therefore it is necessary to control the intensity of light-based microcontroller to regulate the lighting of a room automatically. this research was made by designing a lighting model using a dimmer circuit based onATMega328 microcontroller, LDR sensor (Light Dependent Resistor) and Bluetooth HC-06.**


> # **Research**

**In this we are going to interface LDR with ATMEGA8 microcontroller, and with this we can measure LIGHT INTENSITY in the area. In ATMEGA8, we are going to use 10bit ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion) feature to measure the light intensity.**

> # **Features**

• **Integrated image collecting and algorithm chip together, All-in-one**

• **Fingerprint can conduct secondary development & embedded into a variety of end products**

• **Low power consumption, low cost, small size, excellent performance**

• **Professional optical technology, precise module manufacturing techniques**

> # **Swot Analysis**

> ### **Strengths**

•	**Light sensors need small voltage and power for its operation.**

•	**Lower in cost, bi-directional and offer moderate response time.**


> ### **Weakness**

**The bad part of this technique is that these simple and amateur-level devices can only measure relative intensity of light and are unable to provide measurements on an absolute scale.**

> ### **Opportunities**

**Optimisation of  LDR will increase its oppurtunity.**

> ### **Threats**

**variation of  value of the resistance has a certain delay.**

> # **4W's and 1H**

> ### **Who**

**Used for common people to know about the intensity of light**


> ### **When**

**Indicates the intensity of light**

> ### **What**
**Measures the intensity**

> ### **Where**

**In all common places where people are in need of light intensity .**

> ### **How**


• **Used at the staircase in order to indicate and make light glow when person enters.**
• **Placed at entrance of malls etc..,in order to sense and open the doors.**


> # **High level Requirements**

•**Interfacing LDR with ATmega328**

•**Measure the light intensity in a particular area**


> # **Low level Requirements**

•**LDR should change its resistance when light fall on its surface.** 

•**capacitor**

•**Transistor**
